## ✨ 1. Introduction

Welcome to the **Recipe Applications**!

These applications are **comprehensive C# projects** designed to simplify the process of storing, managing, and analyzing your favorite recipes. Its core mission was inspired by the desire to help anyone start their journey into mastering the culinary arts.

The project began as a robust **command-line application** which allowed users to input the ingredients and steps for a single recipe, with the key feature of scaling the ingredient quantities by factors of 0.5, 2, or 3. It quickly evolved to support an unlimited number of recipes and was upgraded with a nutritional tracking system. This system allows the user to record calorie counts and food groups for each ingredient, calculates the total recipe calories, and uses a delegate to notify the user if a recipe's total calories exceed 300.

The final form of the application is a modern, user-friendly graphical interface built with **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)**. This front-end maintains all prior functionality while introducing advanced features, specifically the ability to filter the recipe list by ingredient, food group, or maximum calorie count, making recipe management intuitive and powerful.

From a simple console tool to a fully-featured desktop application, the Recipe Application is built to be the essential tool in your digital kitchen.

## 🏗️ 6. Architecture

### Command Line Application Architecture

#### Layered/N-Tier Architecture

The Command Line Application follows a **Layered/N-Tier architecture**:

* **Presentation Layer (The Console)**: This layer handles user input (reading arguments, interactive prompts) and output (printing results).
* **Business Logic Layer**: This contains the core logic, rules, and operations of the application, independent of the input/output method.
* **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: This layer handles communication with data sources (e.g., files, databases, APIs - if any).

**Common Patterns**: Console apps leverage patterns like **Service Layer** to encapsulate business operations.

### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Application Architecture

The Windows Presentation Foundatio (WPF) application, being a graphical user interface (GUIs), follows a **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**.

#### Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

MVVM is specifically designed for XAML-based UI frameworks like WPF and Silverlight. 

**Model**:
* Represents the **data and business logic** (e.g., classes that hold data, services that fetch data, validation rules).
* It's completely **UI-independent**.

**View**:
* The **UI defined in XAML** (e.g., windows, controls, data templates).
* It defines the visual structure and appearance.
* It has a reference to the ViewModel via **Data Binding**.

**ViewModel**:
* Acts as a **bridge** between the View and the Model.
* It **exposes data and commands** from the Model in a way that is easy for the View to consume.
* It implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` to automatically update the View when data changes and uses `ICommand` to handle UI actions.
